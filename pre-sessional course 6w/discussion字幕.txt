[00:00:05]So how was it? What did I miss.
[00:00:05]怎么样?我错过了什么?
[00:00:10]Um, was it about you missed A-I can't hey i okay so would You like my run down the four main points.
[00:00:10]是关于你错过a的事吗，我不能，嘿，我，好吧，那你想听我总结一下四个要点吗。
[00:00:19]I guess maybe one at a time, is it.
[00:00:19]我想也许一次一个，对吧。
[00:00:24]Could say long and probably not what was the main thing. What's the main point.
[00:00:24]可以说很长，但可能说不出主要是什么。重点是什么?
[00:00:32]Would you say.
[00:00:32]你会说。
[00:00:35]I think maybe that we don't really know how AI is impacting us in the future, but it definitely is, in a big way they the main take away.
[00:00:35]我想也许我们真的不知道人工智能在未来会如何影响我们，但它绝对是，在很大程度上，它们是主要的收获。
[00:00:45]I think so so there there are lots of sort of hints of things what might happen or but I think you're right it was all about how we're unsure what the effects of AI are going to be on.
[00:00:45]我认为是这样的，所以有很多可能发生的事情的暗示，但我认为你是对的，这都是关于我们如何不确定人工智能的影响将会是什么。
[00:00:55]Education, but also in the workplace as well, so there's a lot of uncertainty that's causing anxiety and.
[00:00:55]教育，工作场所也是如此，所以有很多不确定性导致焦虑和。
[00:01:03]And paralysis as well I think because we we don't really know what steps is that we need to take or what we should be preparing for um, she said at the start. There has both positive and negative impacts.
[00:01:03]我认为瘫痪也是如此，因为我们不知道我们需要采取什么步骤，或者我们应该为什么做准备，她在开始时说。有积极和消极的影响。
[00:01:15]I don't know if I can remember any positive impacts that she mentioned. Can you Well, in terms of in education, obviously it's. It's. Another. Source of. Knowledge.
[00:01:15]我不知道我是否记得她提到的任何积极的影响。你能不能就教育而言，很明显。它是。另一个地方。的来源。知识。
[00:01:26]And it's another source of support. So, you know, these tools are very good at helping to.
[00:01:26]这是另一个支持来源。所以，你知道，这些工具非常善于帮助。
[00:01:34]Um pass information to summarize articles or to I mean do you mean that that. When she was talking about outside of education it was mainly negative.
[00:01:34]传递信息来总结文章，我是说你是说。当她谈到教育之外的时候，主要是负面的。
[00:01:44]And the only post it was in the education sphere um it felt like surely why not I mean if it's another. Source, of, knowledge? In. Education,
[00:01:44]唯一的帖子是在教育领域的，我觉得为什么不呢，我是说，如果它是另一个。知识的来源?在。教育,
[00:01:53]Why can that not be taken over into the workplace? I mean, you could argue that businesses don't operate as well as they can because they.
[00:01:53]为什么工作场所不能采用这种方法呢?我的意思是，你可以争辩说企业没有像他们能做的那样好，因为他们。
[00:02:02]Lack the necessary information to do their job well enough, as well as it could be. So if AI is useful for that. In, education. Why, is? That.
[00:02:02]缺乏必要的信息来做好他们的工作。所以如果人工智能在这方面有用。在教育。为什么,是什么?那。
[00:02:12]Not also the case, but she did mention those kind of things, but I suppose there's kind of a negative slant in that, okay, AI could do all of these jobs, which you could say, this is great, this is kind of easing the burden on us.
[00:02:12]也不是这样，但她确实提到了这些事情，但我想这里面有一种消极的倾向，好吧，人工智能可以做所有这些工作，你可能会说，这太棒了，这减轻了我们的负担。
[00:02:23]But I, but the, the emphasis seem to be on what does that mean for people, does it mean that we're not gonna have jobs in the future or not, not able? That's. One. thing she said.
[00:02:23]但是我，但是，重点似乎是这对人们意味着什么，这是否意味着我们将来不会有工作，或者不能?这是。一个。她说的话。
[00:02:32]Cause people have said that for the last 200 years, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, every single technology is? Presented. By, some, as,
[00:02:32]因为人们说在过去的200年里，从工业革命开始，每一项技术都是?提出了。By, some, as，
[00:02:44]The end of work as we know it, we're all going to be, you know, in bed 24 seven Well, I do think that when she was talking about the sort of perishable skills and so on I mean. Most skills are perishable.
[00:02:44]我们都知道，工作结束后，我们都会，你知道，24小时7小时躺在床上，我确实认为当她谈到那种易逝的技能时，我的意思是。大多数技能都是易逝的。
[00:02:56]Demand for blacksmiths is is not what it was and so you know. Skills are valued in society always.
[00:02:56]对铁匠的需求已经大不如前了，所以你知道。技能在社会上总是受到重视的。
[00:03:06]Change summer.
[00:03:06]夏天改变。
[00:03:08]Did she give any evidence as to why or how, what kind of numbers would be involved with this, because if you go back to the seventies, the introduction. Of robots. In.
[00:03:08]她有没有给出任何证据说明为什么或如何，什么样的数字会涉及到这一点，因为如果你回到70年代，引言。的机器人。在。
[00:03:20]See, in a large scale industry there was always talk about the fact that.
[00:03:20]你看，在一个大规模的工业中，人们总是谈论这样一个事实。
[00:03:26]We would be moving from a an eight, to six, work? Shift.
[00:03:26]我们会从8到6，对吧?转变。
[00:03:32]Five and half days a week we'd end up being at work for a day and a half a week maximum, and what would we do with our free time? This would cause a massive panic in society because.
[00:03:32]每周5天半，我们最多一周工作一天半，那我们的空闲时间该怎么办呢?这会在社会上引起巨大的恐慌，因为。
[00:03:44]Nobody would know what to do with all of this free time. I mean, it, surely that's just the same argument that's given at the moment, I don't know whether she said it, but in the papers and everything that's.
[00:03:44]没有人会知道如何利用这些空闲时间。我的意思是，这肯定和现在给出的论点是一样的，我不知道她是否说过，但在报纸和所有的东西上。
[00:03:55]One of the arguments against AI is that it's just gonna destroy the workplace, and we'll not have enough money to support people, and yet that's not, never been the case. We work more hours now.
[00:03:55]反对人工智能的一个论点是，它只会摧毁工作场所，我们将没有足够的钱来养活人们，但事实并非如此。我们现在工作时间更长了。
[00:04:07]Than we did in the 19 well, depends whether you think destroying the workplace is a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, you know, we could move to a four day week and then a three day week and a two day week, and I think people would be quite happy with that.
[00:04:07]比我们在19世纪做的好，这取决于你认为破坏工作场所是好事还是坏事。我的意思是，你知道，我们可以改成四天工作制，然后是三天工作制，然后是两天工作制，我想人们会很高兴的。
[00:04:22]Um, but it would require sort of political solutions about how we run the economy, so, you know, discussions are universal basic income. And. Things. Like that. How. We.
[00:04:22]但这需要某种政治上的解决方案，关于我们如何运行经济，所以，你知道，讨论的是全民基本收入。和。的事情。像这样。如何去做。我们。
[00:04:30]Allocate resources and divide resources would have to change if it's not based on work.
[00:04:30]如果不以工作为基础，资源的分配和划分就必须改变。
[00:04:37]So I think the first two of her points were kind of what we've discussed through about change of job, and then also the upskilling needed or the fear of upskilling being Needed.
[00:04:37]我认为她的前两个观点是我们讨论过的关于换工作，以及需要提高技能或者担心被需要提高技能。
[00:04:49]Um she also talked about the mental health impacts and again I felt like oh it was quite negative but some of the things that she said are questions like she talked About.
[00:04:49]她还谈到了对心理健康的影响我觉得这很消极但是她说的一些问题就像她说的那样。
[00:05:00]Having a negative impact on even the family relationships and I'm not, not sure I can make that connection in my head. I mean, one of the things that is again was.
[00:05:00]甚至会对家庭关系产生负面影响我不确定我能否在脑海中建立这种联系。我的意思是，其中一件事是。
[00:05:12]Has been suggested in the media over the last 2030 years is the fact that.
[00:05:12]在过去的2030年里被媒体所暗示的事实是。
[00:05:20]Increasingly, in advanced capital societies, we leave our old people to rocks on their own at home. And. Robots could be.
[00:05:20]在发达的资本社会中，我们越来越多地把老年人留在家里，让他们独自生活。和。机器人可以。
[00:05:31]Usefully employed in keeping them entertained, aha, and films been a bread share in there maybe, I don't. Know.
[00:05:31]有效地让他们娱乐，啊哈，电影可能是他们的面包份额，我不这么认为。知道。
[00:05:40]Looking after them and, you know, maintaining that their social skills um.
[00:05:40]照顾他们，保持他们的社交能力。
[00:05:47]Because we seem to have given up in the, in, in the, in the Western.
[00:05:47]因为在西方，我们似乎已经放弃了。
[00:05:51]Society is on the old um so may maybe there are upsides to it. Some AI could be a much better conversation less with.
[00:05:51]社会是老的，所以也许也许有好处。一些人工智能可能是一个更好的对话少。
[00:06:00]You know your grandma and and nutrition right. I suppose you know if it could lead to a more atomized society if we don't need support of.
[00:06:00]你知道你的奶奶和营养是对的。我想你知道如果我们不需要支持它是否会导致一个更加原子化的社会。
[00:06:11]Friends, family, colleagues, to find things out. So, you know, it might be that it's possible to find all the information you need to do a task or something, just by interacting with some AI assistant,
[00:06:11]朋友，家人，同事，来找出真相。所以，你知道，也许有可能找到完成任务或其他事情所需的所有信息，只需要与一些人工智能助手互动，
[00:06:22]Where in the past it may have been asking friends, asking colleagues, and so on, so it could lead to less face, facing And you just said about the.
[00:06:22]在过去可能是问朋友，问同事，等等，所以可能会导致少面对，面对你刚才说的。
[00:06:31]Move towards working less could be seen either, either positive or negative, and we can say the same about that. Maybe currently we waste too much of our time.
[00:06:31]减少工作量既可以是积极的，也可以是消极的，我们也可以这样说。也许现在我们浪费了太多的时间。
[00:06:41]Asking our colleagues for trivial things that we could find out just by looking at you say that that Google can be now in the moment, instead of finding out for yourself, you end up emailing, then texting then.
[00:06:41]向我们的同事询问一些琐碎的事情，我们可以通过观察你来发现，谷歌现在可以做到，而不是自己去发现，你最终会发电子邮件，然后发短信。
[00:06:55]We chatting somebody to say, why are you not responding to my initial phone call about, I think underneath all of that is it's, it's a much bigger question than technology isn't. It's a question about the distribution of power in society.
[00:06:55]我们聊天的时候有人说，为什么你不回应我最初的电话，我认为在这一切的背后，这是一个比技术更大的问题。这是一个关于社会权力分配的问题。
[00:07:07]And who controls um you know these AI assistance and the technology. Who has access to them so you could see a world where.
[00:07:07]谁来控制这些人工智能辅助和技术。谁能接触到它们，这样你就能看到一个世界。
[00:07:17]Work less work is required as either positive or negative, depending on how equitable the world is, so you, you could see it as some kind of socialist utopia where people have. Lots of. free time.
[00:07:17]减少工作的需求是积极的还是消极的，这取决于世界的公平程度，所以你可以把它看作是某种社会主义乌托邦，人们有。很多的。自由时间。
[00:07:32]Or it could be somewhere where, where everyone is completely controlled by a very small minority with all the power and access.
[00:07:32]或者它可能是一个地方，在那里，每个人都完全由极少数人控制，拥有所有的权力和权限。
[00:07:43]To the technology and this huge mass of, like this underclass, which I have, have nothing to do and exploited.
[00:07:43]对科技和这一大批，像我所拥有的，无事可做，被剥削的下层阶级。
[00:07:53]That sounds quite dystopian, but I think, I think you know, both our possibilities, the, the technology in itself is not inherently good or bad, it's a question of who controls it and who has access to it.
[00:07:53]这听起来很反乌托邦，但我认为，你们知道，我们的两种可能性，技术本身没有好坏之分，问题是谁控制它，谁能接触到它。
[00:08:06]And that is obviously the same as with every piece of technology. So in that sense, AI is no different to any other thing. The invention. Of. The. Wheel benefited. Some.
[00:08:06]这显然和所有的技术都是一样的。所以从这个意义上说，人工智能和其他东西没有什么不同。这项发明。的。的。轮中受益。一些。
[00:08:16]And didn't benefit her this did it so I mean so what was the fourth point do you said there were four points What was the fourth point um.
[00:08:16]这对她没有好处所以我的意思是第四点是什么你说有四点，第四点是什么?
[00:08:25]It was about the environment, and she's quite brief about it, but she talked a bit about how costly it is to run AI in terms of environmental impact.
[00:08:25]这是关于环境的，她说得很简短，但她谈到了在环境影响方面运行人工智能的成本有多高。
[00:08:35]I mean, I've heard, you know, you know you can get AI to generate images and whatever the, apparently the cost of those generating those images is.
[00:08:35]我的意思是，我听说过，你知道，你知道你可以让人工智能生成图像，无论如何，显然生成这些图像的成本是多少。
[00:08:43]Some massive multiple of the average bus journey, or something like that. So if we're doing that on a regular basis, of course that's gonna have massive impacts on the amount of energy that we need to generate.
[00:08:43]大概是普通公交车的几倍，或者类似的。因此，如果我们经常这样做，当然会对我们需要产生的能量产生巨大的影响。
[00:08:57]And as we say that electricity generation is one of the, or if not the greatest, source of C-O two pollution.
[00:08:57]正如我们所说，发电是二氧化碳污染的来源之一，如果不是最大的来源的话。
[00:09:06]You know the move towards renewable energy well that's way down the you know the the time scale isn't it I mean the it's. Going to. Be. That the. Majority. Of.
[00:09:06]大家都知道，向可再生能源的转变在时间尺度上是很低的不是吗?我是说。要。是。的。多数。的。
[00:09:16]Energy production is pollution, polluting for the next at least 1015 years, and the rapid rise in AI is can have massive impacts.
[00:09:16]能源生产就是污染，至少在接下来的1015年里会造成污染，而人工智能的迅速崛起可能会产生巨大的影响。
[00:09:26]I think also, there's a lot of unnecessary use of AI, you could argue, when you think about how people are using it in sort of ways of producing things for social media, or like people start talking about deep fakes and things like that.
[00:09:26]我也认为，人工智能有很多不必要的使用，你可以争辩说，当你想到人们是如何使用它来为社交媒体制作东西的，或者人们开始谈论深度造假之类的事情。
[00:09:40]As well, I think if we think about how much it costs to use AI, you saw question, where are we using it, and should we always be using it in all these situations.
[00:09:40]同时，我认为如果我们考虑使用人工智能的成本，你看到的问题是，我们在哪里使用它，我们是否应该在所有这些情况下都使用它。
[00:09:49]But so what solution that that we should have a trigger warning, you know, do you know you are killing the planet by generating this me. Or. Something I. Mean. That.
[00:09:49]但是我们应该有一个触发警告的解决方案，你知道，你是否知道你正在通过制造这个我来杀死这个星球。或。我的意思是。那。
[00:09:58]Things a bit excessive doesn't it I mean you could we could be at a cost to using it like charge but obviously then that that feeds into its vision to what you would say here, because, I mean, disney are not considering that, are they when.
[00:09:58]事情有点过分，不是吗，我的意思是你可以我们可以在使用它的成本，像收费，但很明显，这是它的愿景，你会说，因为，我的意思是，迪斯尼没有考虑到这一点，他们什么时候。
[00:10:11]Disney are using AI to generate their next blockbuster, presumably they're not thinking, well, it is totally frivolous and I should give up the. coast in the Hollywood. I mean, they are so who who's to decide.
[00:10:11]迪士尼正在使用人工智能来制作他们的下一部大片，想必他们不会想，好吧，这完全是无聊的，我应该放弃。好莱坞的海岸。我是说，他们是谁来决定。
[00:10:22]You know when power consumption is a valid use of AI and when AI is is.
[00:10:22]你知道什么时候功耗是人工智能的有效使用，什么时候是。
[00:10:30]To be stopped. I mean, so you said it's 1015 years in the future, and you're right, and maybe it's even more, but ultimately the, the answer to that problem has to be renewable energy.
[00:10:30]被阻止。我的意思是，你说这是未来1015年，你是对的，也许还要更久，但最终，解决这个问题的答案必须是可再生能源。
[00:10:42]Because the, the demand for, for this kind of technology is not going to go away, and either we restrict access to it which has.
[00:10:42]因为，对这种技术的需求不会消失，或者我们限制它的使用。
[00:10:51]Issues of equity, or we find ways of generating it, or we use a way to find the solutions, well, why possibly yes so these frivolously, as a counselor to, well, kill the planet by saving.
[00:10:51]公平的问题，或者我们找到产生它的方法，或者我们用一种方法找到解决方案，嗯，为什么可能是这样，作为一个顾问，嗯，通过拯救来杀死地球。
[00:11:04]But, you know, the, the solutions are not complicated, renewable energy is, is realistic. Well, you say they're not complicated, but if the technology is there, why is it not being used? You could argue that that's.
[00:11:04]但是，你知道，解决方案并不复杂，可再生能源是现实的。好吧，你说它们并不复杂，但如果技术在那里，为什么它没有被使用?你可以说这是。
[00:11:15]Political, social thing, or maybe AI is the one that could find a navigable path through that.
[00:11:15]政治，社会的东西，或者也许人工智能可以找到一条可导航的路径。
[00:11:22]In a seemingly impossible maze to to translation seem you you mentioned something earlier briefly just about like a bit of um deep fakes. I think that's quite an interesting point about some of the ethical issues of.
[00:11:22]在一个看似不可能的迷宫中去翻译，似乎你之前简单地提到了一些东西，就像有点深的假。我认为这是一个很有趣的关于道德问题的观点。
[00:11:36]How, how do we trust some of this information, how do we know that what we're being given is actually what it's purported to be.
[00:11:36]我们如何相信这些信息，我们如何知道我们所得到的实际上是它所声称的。
[00:11:45]So I mean the deep faking of someone's voice or images is one issue um but you could such say more generally like? The reliability? Of the? Information.
[00:11:45]所以我的意思是某人的声音或图像的深度伪造是一个问题但是你可以更一般地说，比如?的可靠性?的吗?信息。
[00:11:56]As well is is is something that we haven't really solved um. I think it also raises questions of like the whole some interest creative industries.
[00:11:56]这也是我们还没解决的问题。我认为这也提出了一些问题，比如整个创意产业的兴趣。
[00:12:07]What is art? What is music? Now that AI can produce those things, does that take away from the skill set required? And have we changed the face of those industries.
[00:12:07]什么是艺术?什么是音乐?既然人工智能可以生产这些东西，这是否会降低所需的技能?我们是否改变了这些行业的面貌?
[00:12:19]Is that a positive thing or a negative thing, but I-I mean and that is a philosophical question is it what, is the value of art? What is the nature of art.
[00:12:19]这是好事还是坏事，但我的意思是这是一个哲学问题艺术的价值是什么?艺术的本质是什么?
[00:12:28]But then you could also argue that that has always been the case in the production of art, isn't it? So even, let's say. Since. The year. 2000.
[00:12:28]但你也可以争辩说，在艺术生产中一直都是这样，不是吗?所以我们说。自。今年。2000.
[00:12:37]With the increasing digital technology, non AI technology, the use of sampling and, you know, copying and melding. Different genres and.
[00:12:37]随着数字技术的发展，非人工智能技术，采样的使用，你知道，复制和融合。不同的类型和。
[00:12:49]You know, different cuts that you've taken from other artists has been. You. Know the.
[00:12:49]你知道，你从其他艺术家那里得到的不同的剪辑。你。知道的。
[00:13:16]Nor has it, most of you could argue, modern music since the year 2000, or really, has been very directly using other people's work.
[00:13:16]你们大多数人可能会说，自2000年以来，现代音乐也没有直接使用别人的作品。
[00:13:32]So is AI any different? Maybe it might be more difficult to know the dividing line between original and.
[00:13:32]那么人工智能有什么不同吗?也许要区分原创和原创之间的界限会更加困难。
[00:13:41]Produced or, or copied, faked, whatever, but I guess that's only because the amount of things that they can draw upon is.
[00:13:41]制作，复制，伪造，无论什么，但我想这只是因为他们可以借鉴的东西的数量。
[00:13:52]Is wider as time passes. I think art always copies and steels and builds on other art. I-I suppose maybe the difference is we like art because we think the artist is trying to communicate something.
[00:13:52]随着时间的流逝而变宽。我认为艺术总是复制、强化和构建其他艺术。我想也许不同之处在于我们喜欢艺术是因为我们认为艺术家试图传达一些东西。
[00:14:04]And if the artist is just a piece of technology, in isn't, it doesn't feel like they're trying to communicate something, but suddenly it feels like it has less meaning.
[00:14:04]如果艺术家只是一种技术，那就不会让人觉得他们在试图传达什么东西，而是突然感觉它没有那么有意义。
[00:14:15]But then he could also also argue that art is really an act of curation, it's not what is produced it is what is distributed.
[00:14:15]但他也可以认为艺术实际上是一种管理行为，它不是被生产出来的东西，而是被分发出去的东西。
[00:14:25]And so, you know, there, there are millions of artists around the world, is only a very, very small number of those that you get to see.
[00:14:25]所以，你知道，世界上有成千上万的艺术家，你能看到的只是其中非常非常少的一部分。
[00:14:33]Because there is an industry which determines the roots of distribution, so, you know, what we are exposed to, even in terms of. Music. Is only that. Which. Is.
[00:14:33]因为有一个行业决定了分销的根基，所以，你知道，我们所接触到的，甚至是。音乐。仅此而已。哪一个。是多少。
[00:14:46]Disputed by mega corporations, isn't it say.
[00:14:46]被大公司所争议，不是吗。
[00:14:51]Then, I suppose, are we deterring people from entering those industries, if that is becoming a narrow field where you're competing not just with other artists or the musicians but also.
[00:14:51]那么，我想，我们是否阻止了人们进入这些行业，如果这变成了一个狭窄的领域，你不仅要和其他艺术家或音乐家竞争，还要。
[00:15:00]Technology, and it's even less likely that you'll make an income from it, they are we losing a whole skill set and a whole value of that part of society work, and had comes to that,
[00:15:00]技术，你甚至不太可能从中赚钱，我们正在失去一整套技能和整个社会工作的价值，已经到了这个地步，
[00:15:11]Goes backload, isn't it To the, all technologies have said this, you know, the introduction of electronic recording was the death of music And yet.
[00:15:11]所有的技术都是这么说的，你知道，电子录音的引入是音乐的死亡，然而。
[00:15:22]There are more musicians now than there have ever been at any other point in human. History one. Would. Argue.
[00:15:22]现在的音乐家比人类历史上任何时期都多。一个历史。会。争论。
[00:15:27]Um, so you know, are we just opening up new forms of music. Are we going to just create a whole new level of creativity that.
[00:15:27]嗯，所以你知道，我们只是在开辟新的音乐形式。我们是不是要创造一个全新的创造力水平。
